from ..data.schedule import Section

'''
A collection of functions to index course data.

No function in this class reads data from the data files, just works on them. 
This helps keep the program modular by seperating the data from 
the data indexing

# Converts a section ID to a course ID.
def get_course_id(section_id):
  result = section_id[0:section_id.index("-")]
  #if result.startswith("0"):
   # return result[1:]
  #else:
  return result

	# Builds a list of [Section] objects.
	# 
	# This function works by taking several arguments: 
	# 
	# - courseNames, from [section_reader.course_names]
	# - sectionTeachers, from [section_reader.get_section_faculty_ids]
	# - facultyNames, from [faculty_reader.get_faculty]
	# 
	# These are kept as parameters instead of calling the functions by itself
	# in order to keep the data and logic layers separate.
